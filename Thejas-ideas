Potential Unique Approaches:
1. Career Coach Focus (Not Just Hiring)
Analyze interviews to help candidates improve

"Why didn't you get the job?" → specific feedback on communication

2. Transparency Dashboard
Show EXACTLY what the AI is detecting

"We detected nervousness at 3:25 because of increased blink rate"

Build trust through explainability

3. Bias Detection Mode
Instead of judging candidates, detect interviewer bias

"The interviewer interrupted female candidates 3x more often"

4. Free Tier for Job Seekers
Let candidates practice and self-assess before real interviews

🚨 Important Legal/Ethical Considerations:
Don't claim your AI can predict job performance

Focus on skills development rather than selection

Emphasize transparency over black-box decisions

🎤 Your Pitch Could Be:
text
"Existing tools like HireVue are expensive black boxes 
that reject candidates without explanation. We're building
an open platform that helps BOTH candidates improve their
communication skills AND helps HR make more informed decisions."
